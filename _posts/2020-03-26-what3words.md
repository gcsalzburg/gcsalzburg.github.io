I have been a fan of the [What3words](https://what3words.com/timing.bakers.length) concept for a long time. One of the big pains of referencing places in the world is the lack of a global, user-friendly mapping standard. Lat/long co-ordinates are error prone to read out and always require a sanity check to avoid easy confusion between the decimal and degrees-minutes-seconds format. In the UK, we have the OS grid system, but even this requires some (very minimal) training to understand, as the many hillwalkers rescued annually by Mountain Rescue can attest to.

Consequently, the idea of slicing the word into 3x3m squares and assigning a unique three word string to each location appeals to me. Even more so, I find the choice of words quite fascinating. There are 57x10¹² of these squares, and a 40000 word dictionary gives you enough unique combinations (40000³ =64x10¹²).

The dictionary is a marvellous traverse through the English language from the mundane (`farm`, `cars`, `this`), to the obscure (`promethean`, `skittish`, `dollops`), to quite a few I've never heard of (`obstetrics`, `culottes`, `bravura`). Though it wasn't the intent, the creators of What3Words have stumbled upon a marvellous tool to explore the English language with.

I wanted to find a way to bring this dictionary to life.

## Building the W3W locator

My idea was to create a small box that I could roam the world with. It would constantly spit out the 3-word address for wherever I was stood, an endless cycle of seemingly arbitrary (yet incredibly precise) descriptors. Rather than hook up some connectivity and hammer the [What3Words API](https://developer.what3words.com/public-api), I wanted to run the entire algorithm self-contained.

### Pseudo-code

It can help to start with a skeleton of how the interface should work. Here was mine:

```c++
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <w3w.h>

void setup() {   
   String words[3];
   latlon2words(words, 51.450493, -2.594689); /* words = {"wash","goat","doctor"} */
}

void loop() {
}
```

### Building the algorithm

To create the `latlon2words()` function, I ported the open-source [WhatFreeWords](https://whatfreewords.net/js.html) implementation of the algorithm to C++.

This introducted a number of challenges. To fit the code onto a low-cost ARM processor, the large arrays of `word_data` and `regions_y` data are saved to `.txt` files and loaded from the SD card. For this reason I put the whole project on a [Teensy 3.6](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy36.html), because it was fastest board I had available and also has a built-in micro SD card socket. 

The second challenge is that the `regions_y` object in Javascript is a multi-dimensional array which cannot easily be converted to a C++ data structure.

However, the w3w algorithm does not iterate over this whole object, but searches within one of these nodes only. Thus to increase the overall speed, each child of the object has been saved to a single text file, resulting in 4319 distinct files, each a representation of a fixed length array for a given region.

The node.js code to generate this data is found in the js-regions-builder/ folder.

### Testing

```c++
void test_w3w(){
   String words[3];

   Serial.print(latlon2words(words, 58.657328, -6.210225));
   Serial.print(" : ");
   Serial.println(words2phrase(words));       // squiggly.fortify.mountaintops

   Serial.print(latlon2words(words, 63.379541, -45.145744));
   Serial.print(" : ");
   Serial.println(words2phrase(words));       // legibility.bamboo.captivated

   Serial.print(latlon2words(words, -13.330113, 55.137452));
   Serial.print(" : ");
   Serial.println(words2phrase(words));       // indefinitely.subgroup.careers

   Serial.print(latlon2words(words, -72.290522, -72.391889));
   Serial.print(" : ");
   Serial.println(words2phrase(words));       // marches.quelling.primroses

   Serial.print(latlon2words(words, 9.444359, -87.069577));
   Serial.print(" : ");
   Serial.println(words2phrase(words));       // earmarked.tipping.balsam
}
```
