strapline: Learning DFMA from a rotary dial telephone

## DFMA ##

DFMA stands for Design for Manufacturing and Assembly. In a traditional model of engineering development, DFMA is the act of converting concepts and prototype designs into finished designs suitable for mass-manufacture by whatever processes is most appropriate for the desired production volume.

Over time I've become especially wary of any conversations which revolve around "applying DFMA to x". Ideation and product development must always consider materials and manufacturing processes from the very beginning. Treating DFMA as a stage on a development pipeline that comes somewhere near the end results in a dangerous mindset and approach to design.

This is a subject for a future discussion however.

Last week I bought this wonderful old rotary dial telephone from a flea market in Germany. The original intent was to gut the insides and refit it for a more digital future, however the internal design is such a masterclass in design for repair and servicing that I haven't yet had the heart to butcher it.

## Lessons ##

Under the cover, this telephone superbly illustrates five important points that are often lost in the rush to optimise designs for high volume, automated manufacturing processes: 

1. Easy to dismantle
2. Self-documenting design
3. Clear documentation
4. Design for repair
5. Design for (re-)assembly

### 1. Easy to dismantle ###

Single captive screw / flat head screw so not tool specific. Captive so it doesn't get lost.

### 2. Self-documenting design ###

In programming we talk about self-documenting design. Same in physical products. Wiring looms routed clearly and logically between parts.

### 3. Clear documentation ###

Printed schematic to aid fault finding!

### 4. Design for repair ###

Car engines good vs. bad. Individual components easy to replace without moving other parts.
Doesn't need to be re-orientated to open and inspect

### 5. Design for (re-)assembly ###

Factory design for re-assembly vs. 

We can learn so much from the masters of old.
