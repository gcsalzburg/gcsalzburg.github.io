I built a QR code containing the credentials for our home WiFi, thanks to a bulk purchase of 1x1 stud bricks from Bricklink. 1681 bricks later and my wife has to tolerate this artwork on our living room wall.",

   "description": "Reinventing the analog magic of the Kodak Instamatic for the digital age. Using an ESP32 camera module and a lot of mechanical modifications. The original advance film & shutter mechanism triggers a new photo capture, which is instantly uploaded to Instagram.
